# CONTROL PLANE SUIVI

Durable chronological history for the source/control-plane repository only.

## 2026-09-26 — Self-governance gap identified

Observed that the repository already distributes persistent-memory primitives to clients but its own root project-state files remain intentionally templated with placeholders.

Confirmed existing source history was primarily recoverable through Git, issues and conversation context rather than a dedicated source-only authority set.

Decision: introduce a separate source-only memory namespace instead of converting distributed root templates into source-project state.

## 2026-09-26 — CREATE_NEW_REPOSITORY pilot checkpoint

- Template reached V2.6.10.
- `Patricked-code/Gouvern` completed first-agent baseline.
- Pilot baseline commit: `23975e0435e63fb45d7436d1f23ce8ce0a450a5f`.
- Pilot local-entry state: `LOCAL_HANDOFF_READY`.
- DIRECT MCP discovery: PASS.
- SSH OIDC discovery: PASS.
- Domain binding intentionally remains `UNRESOLVED`.
- MCP/SSH write authority remained disabled.
- Canonical framework program #12 advanced to the second fresh repository E2E proof.

## 2026-09-26 — V2.7.0 started

Purpose: make the control-plane source self-governed while guaranteeing that its own historical state never becomes client project history.

## 2026-09-26 — V2.7.0 source/client boundary proven

- Governance CI run: `36258871067` — PASS.
- Source authority coherence validation: PASS.
- Bootstrap client simulation: PASS.
- `docs/control-plane/` removed from initialized client: PASS.
- `.governance/control-plane-state/` removed from initialized client: PASS.
- Next: merge V2.7.0 and attest resulting canonical main HEAD.
